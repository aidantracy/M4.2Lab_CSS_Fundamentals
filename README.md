# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project is a personal gauge of where I am at with my css skills and figure out what I need to review before jumping into future projects.


## Setup

To start, you will need to have live preview enabled. Click on the explorer tab on the left hand side if it is not showing a file hierarchy. Once shown, right click on the index.html file and click "show preview"
